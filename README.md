Introduction
------------

A proof-of-concept of cooperation framework in a distributed system of IoT.

Scenario
--------

This implementation is set in a scenario where:

- You ask your microwave oven for a dinner by sending a voice message via whatsapp/wechat etc.
- But your cell phone is shared with your wife or even already stolen!
- So the microwave needs to tell who is the real commander and decide which food style it should provide.
- Specifically we use iOS as the client to send voice message and implement a python program to mock the microwave oven.
- It is clearly not limited in this setting, however, easy to be applied to other settings of IoT.
